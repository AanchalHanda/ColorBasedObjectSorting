# ColorBasedObjectSorting
MakerSpace Project.
This project is based on sorting of objects on the basis of the color. 
Intially sorting will be done by using TCS3200 color sensors and microcontroller Atmega 128.
Afterwards the color sensing will be done by using image processing to segregate objects based on colors.
The mechanism will include a rotating platformm made up of sttrofoam or cardboard mounted on a server motor where balls will be put into different tube based upon their color.
